# Binary Search Number Guessing Game

### Description
This is a number guessing game based on the binary search algorithm. It takes the hints **above** and **below** and guesses the number the player is thinking of. 

When the player clicks above, the number displayed plus its result when added with 30 and put in the binary search formula - a+b/2. When the player clicks below, the number is divided by 2. This logic and a few test-cases which me and my buddy worked out together are in the brainStorming folder.

Note: This game is supposed to be an age guesser and doesn't do well when the number is an abnormal age
